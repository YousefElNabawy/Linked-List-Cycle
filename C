Explanation:
.We start by checking if head is nullptr or if head->next is nullptr. If either is true, then the list has no cycle (it’s either empty or has only one node with no cycle).
.We initialize two pointers, slow and fast. slow moves one step at a time, while fast moves two steps.
.In each iteration of the while loop, we check if fast or fast->next is nullptr. If either is nullptr, then there’s no cycle, and we return false.
.If fast and slow meet at the same node, it means there’s a cycle, and we return true.

bool hasCycle(struct ListNode *head) {
    if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
        return false;
    }
    
    struct ListNode *slow = head;
    struct ListNode *fast = head->next;
    
    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
    
    return false;
}
